# Project-2

1. Our web app is called, "Trail Manager" and its objective is to suggest new trails in the user's area which they may not have heard of before then also to help the user manage and organize the trails they would like to hike.
2. As soon as the user lands on our web app, they are directed to login using their Google account.  We originally designed it this way because we wanted to incorporate the user's own personal Google Calendar.  We were unbale to accomplish that functionality but still plan to incorporate that into future development of our app.
3. Once the user logs in, they are immediately directed to our main 'Trail Manager' page.  On this page they are able to search for trails based on how much time they have to hike that particular trail.  If the user inputs 4 hours then all the trails that pop up they should be able to complete within 4 hours.  
4. Once the user finds one or even a few trails they want to tackle, they can then click on the "Add to Task List" button which will immediately add that trail to their "Trail Task List".
5. Now that the user not only has new trails they know they can hike within their given time-frame but they also have an organized list of trails that they can then check off or "done" once that particular trail has been hiked.

That is our web app called, "Trail Manager" in a nutshell!!
